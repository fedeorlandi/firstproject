    <p><strong>Back in the springtime, when Covid-19 was tightening its grip on the UK, the BBC spoke to a number of people whose jobs were facing the axe as a result of the virus.</strong></p>
    <p>So how have they fared on the jobs front in the past six months? The BBC went back to talk to them to find out how they are getting on.</p>
    <p>When Katherine Densham first spoke to the BBC at Exeter airport in early March, she was understandably upset.</p>
    <p>The airline Flybe, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-51749567">her employer of 13 years</a>, had just collapsed into administration. Cabin crew member Katherine and the good friends she'd made through work were being made redundant.</p>
