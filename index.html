    <p><strong>Back in the springtime, when Covid-19 was tightening its grip on the UK, the BBC spoke to a number of people whose jobs were facing the axe as a result of the virus.</strong></p>
    <p>So how have they fared on the jobs front in the past six months? The BBC went back to talk to them to find out how they are getting on.</p>
    <p>When Katherine Densham first spoke to the BBC at Exeter airport in early March, she was understandably upset.</p>
    <p>The airline Flybe, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-devon-51749567">her employer of 13 years</a>, had just collapsed into administration. Cabin crew member Katherine and the good friends she'd made through work were being made redundant.</p>
    <p>Flybe was described as one of the first corporate casualties of the coronavirus outbreak. A few weeks later, lockdown restrictions were brought in and vast swathes of the UK economy ground to a halt.</p>
    <p>Half a year later, Katherine's job search continues. At Flybe, she worked part-time on set days. The youngest of her three children is only two and therefore not yet entitled to free childcare.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-52135342">How is furlough changing?</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54285950">Sunak defends emergency jobs scheme</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54333640">'We have next to no income. There is no help for us'</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53414413">What jobs are available post-lockdown?</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Finding something similar in her local area has seemed impossible.</p>
    <p><q>You'd think I'd have transferrable skills, but no-one wants to take on part-time staff,</q> she says. <q>A lot of the companies I looked at had halted recruitment, because they just didn't know what would happen.</q></p>
    <p><q>Other jobs were minimum wage, meaning it would cost me more in childcare to return to work. I used to be well paid, it's hard to find anything on the same level without going back and retraining.</q></p>
