            Pubs in Scotland <a class="bodylinks" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-54449573" target="_blank">will be severely restricted under new measures</a> announced
            by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to try to halt the spread of Covid-19.
          </p>
          <h2 class="title_h2">
            What are the new rules in Scotland?
          </h2>
            <p>
              Bars and restaurants in Scotland currently have to close at 22:00 BST.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the new rules, from 18:00 BST on Friday 9 October, 
              all licensed premises in the Central Belt must close completely until Sunday 25 October.
            </p>
            <p>
              That means the area covered by the health boards for Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, Lothian, 
              Forth Valley and Ayrshire and Arran - where cases of the virus have been rising sharply. 
              It includes Edinburgh and Glasgow.
            </p>
            <ul class="listadesordenada">
              <li>
                <a class="bodylinks" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-53511877" target="_blank">Covid-19 in Scotland: Where are the latest cases?
                </a>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Outside the Central Belt, pubs, cafes and restaurants will only be able to open indoors 
              between 06:00 and 18:00 BST, and will not be allowed to sell alcohol during those hours.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, they will be able to serve alcohol outdoors between 1800 and 2200 BST.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hotel restaurants across the country will also be able to serve meals to residents 
              in the evening, but will not be allowed to sell alcohol.
            </p>
            <p>
              Across Scotland, a maximum of six people from up to two households will 
              still be able to meet up in hospitality venues, subject to the revised opening hours.
            </p>
            <p>
              There will be exceptions for "significant life events" such as <a class="bodylinks" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52811509">wedding receptions</a> and funeral wakes, 
              which will be able to continue in line with current rules across the whole of the country.
            </p>
          <h2 class="title_h2">
            What are the rules in England?
          </h2>
            <p>
              Currently, all pubs, bars, restaurants, 
              cafes and other hospitality venues in England must close by 22:00 BST.
            </p>
            <p>
              Venues that are licensed to serve alcohol are restricted by 
              law to table service only, except for takeaways.
            </p>
            <p>
              In all cases, table <a class="bodylinks" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51506729">bookings of more than six are not allowed</a> and groups can't mingle
            </p>
            <p>
              Businesses are legally required to take customers' contact details, so they can be traced 
              if there is an outbreak. They can be fined up to £10,000 if they do not 
              do this or if they take reservations of more than six, or do not enforce social distancing
            </p>
            <p>
              Staff in hospitality venues must now wear masks, as must customers when not seated 
              at their table to eat or drink. The penalty for not wearing one, 
              or breaking the ''rule of six'' has doubled to £200 for a first offence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Further restrictions are also in place in parts of north-east England.
            </p>
            <p>
              People in Durham, Gateshead, Newcastle, North Tyneside, South Tyneside, Northumberland and Sunderland, 
              are <a class="bodylinks" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54373904">banned from mixing in pubs or restaurants</a> with anyone from outside their own household.
            </p>
            <ul class="listadesordenada">

          <h2 class="title_h2">What are the pub rules around the rest of the UK?</h2>

              In <span class="paises">Wales</span>, <a class="bodylinks" href="https://gov.wales/hospitality-and-retail-businesses-frequently-asked-questions">pubs, bars and restaurants stop serving at 22:00</a>, and customers will have to be off the premises 
              by 22:20. Supermarkets and off-licences are not allowed to sell alcohol after that time.
            </p>
            <p>
              In <span class="paises">Northern Ireland</span>, <a class="bodylinks" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-54284765">pubs have to stop serving at 22:30</a> and must shut their doors by 23:00.
            </p>
            <p>
              But pubs that only serve drinks <a class="bodylinks" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-54253146"> can now reopen</a>, joining pubs that also serve food

          <h2 class="title_h2">
              How do social distancing rules affect pubs?
          </h2>
            <p>
              Social distancing across the UK is officially 2m - but in England people can be <a class="bodylinks" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51506729">"1m plus"</a> if they, 
              for instance, wear a face covering or don't sit face-to-face.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pubs, restaurants and cafes can keep individual groups 
              closer than 2m if they take certain steps to keep customers safe.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a class="bodylinks" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54373904">Areas under local restrictions</a> because of high coronavirus rates have different rules.

          </h2>
            <p>
              UK pub and hospitality bodies have published 
              guidance for bars and restaurants on <a class="bodylinks" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-52442754">how to operate contact tracing</a>.

            <ul>
              <li>Contact details only need to be taken from one person in a group</li>
              <li>The details must be kept for 21 days</li>
              <li>Customers only need to give their name and phone number.

            If a customer tests positive, will the pub or restaurant have to close?
          </h2>
            <p>
              Possibly, but not necessarily.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a class="bodylinks" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace">Official government advice</a> says an 
              NHS Test and Trace call does not always mean a pub or restaurant must close.
            </p>
            <p>
              It depends on the circumstances and when the infected person visited.
            </p>
            <p>
              NHS Test and Trace could ask staff to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>get tested for Covid-19</li>
              <li>take extra care with social distancing</li>
              <li>self-isolate "in some circumstances"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Local health protection officials have the power to close establishments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Several pubs have <a class="bodylinks" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-54041094">temporarily closed</a> after customers or 
              staff tested positive for coronavirus.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are contacted personally by NHS Test and Trace, 
              you should follow the advice and be prepared to self-isolate for a fortnight.
