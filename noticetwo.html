            Pubs in Scotland <a class="bodylinks" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-54449573" target="_blank">will be severely restricted under new measures</a> announced
            by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to try to halt the spread of Covid-19.
          </p>
          <h2 class="title_h2">
            What are the new rules in Scotland?
          </h2>
            <p>
              Bars and restaurants in Scotland currently have to close at 22:00 BST.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the new rules, from 18:00 BST on Friday 9 October, 
              all licensed premises in the Central Belt must close completely until Sunday 25 October.
            </p>
            <p>
              That means the area covered by the health boards for Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, Lothian, 
              Forth Valley and Ayrshire and Arran - where cases of the virus have been rising sharply. 
              It includes Edinburgh and Glasgow.
            </p>
            <ul class="listadesordenada">
              <li>
                <a class="bodylinks" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-53511877" target="_blank">Covid-19 in Scotland: Where are the latest cases?
                </a>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Outside the Central Belt, pubs, cafes and restaurants will only be able to open indoors 
              between 06:00 and 18:00 BST, and will not be allowed to sell alcohol during those hours.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, they will be able to serve alcohol outdoors between 1800 and 2200 BST.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hotel restaurants across the country will also be able to serve meals to residents 
              in the evening, but will not be allowed to sell alcohol.
            </p>
            <p>
              Across Scotland, a maximum of six people from up to two households will 
              still be able to meet up in hospitality venues, subject to the revised opening hours.
            </p>
            <p>
              There will be exceptions for "significant life events" such as <a class="bodylinks" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52811509">wedding receptions</a> and funeral wakes, 
              which will be able to continue in line with current rules across the whole of the country.
            </p>
          <h2 class="title_h2">
            What are the rules in England?
          </h2>
            <p>
              Currently, all pubs, bars, restaurants, 
              cafes and other hospitality venues in England must close by 22:00 BST.
            </p>
            <p>
              Venues that are licensed to serve alcohol are restricted by 
              law to table service only, except for takeaways.
            </p>
            <p>
              In all cases, table <a class="bodylinks" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51506729">bookings of more than six are not allowed</a> and groups can't mingle
            </p>
            <p>
              Businesses are legally required to take customers' contact details, so they can be traced 
              if there is an outbreak. They can be fined up to £10,000 if they do not 
              do this or if they take reservations of more than six, or do not enforce social distancing
            </p>
            <p>
              Staff in hospitality venues must now wear masks, as must customers when not seated 
              at their table to eat or drink. The penalty for not wearing one, 
              or breaking the ''rule of six'' has doubled to £200 for a first offence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Further restrictions are also in place in parts of north-east England.
            </p>
            <p>
              People in Durham, Gateshead, Newcastle, North Tyneside, South Tyneside, Northumberland and Sunderland, 
              are <a class="bodylinks" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54373904">banned from mixing in pubs or restaurants</a> with anyone from outside their own household.

              In <span class="paises">Wales</span>, <a class="bodylinks" href="https://gov.wales/hospitality-and-retail-businesses-frequently-asked-questions">pubs, bars and restaurants stop serving at 22:00</a>, and customers will have to be off the premises

            </p>

              In <span class="paises">Northern Ireland</span>, <a class="bodylinks" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-54284765">pubs have to stop serving at 22:30</a> and must shut their doors by 23:00.
